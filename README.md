# css-demo
CSS isn't what I do all the time but once the wheels get turning things get fueled by passion. 
In this situation I worked with some concepts: nth child, transform propreties and overlay positions. 
The real catch here is this is, as you can tell a custom effort. Things come out of inspiration. I think you can tell the difference. 
What I find intriguing are the colors of the nav bar--still working on the nav bar, the flex aspect of the pages and the uniqueness of this 
skeletal effort compared with what is out there. 

Just a taste. 
Passion rules over expediency

Ask yourself a few questions:
  If my website has distinctive appeal will I get more business? 
  If my website has a custom touch does this translate into better public relations and perceptions? 
 The answer is and must be "YES"!
